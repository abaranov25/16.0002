Problem Set 1: Applied IVP Implementation

In this problem set, I implemented an IVP (initial value problem) solver by creating a class and helper methods (both the Runge-Kutta 4 algorithm and 
Euler Method). An IVP problem is a differential equation that cannot be manually solved. The method to computationally solving an IVP is to take timesteps and calculate the rate of change as a function of the current state. 

This was applied to solve for the trajectory of a Martian lander and a hail particle, and plots were made to illustrate the calculated trajectories using
the matplotlib library.
