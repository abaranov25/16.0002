# 16.0002
My coding labs in MIT's 16.0002, Introduction to Computational Science and Engineering (Fall 2021). Credit is due to the creators of the course for creating the assignments. The work is my own and I did not utilize any outside sources, including classmates or the internet, for code in any of these files.

Every lab folder will contain a README.md to explain my task in each lab and a description of the lab itself.
