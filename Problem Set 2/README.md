Problem Set 2: HVAC system. 

In this problem set, I implemented an IVP (see previous problem set) involving a system of matrices (implemented via
NumPy) instead of floats to calculate the evolution of heat spreading in a home with multiple rooms. I also practiced
plotting using the matplotlib library.
